# DROPWAVE: Customization Engine
## The "MySpace Nostalgia" Framework

---

## 🎨 PHILOSOPHY

**Core Insight:** Customization isn't about features—it's about **identity expression**. The feeling of "this is MINE" comes from breaking the template, not following it. We're building controlled chaos.

**The Nostalgia Formula:**
```
Instant Visual Impact + Slight Jankiness + Discovery Joy = "My Space"
```

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE

### THE BUILDER INTERFACE
```javascript
// Split screen on desktop, preview-first on mobile
interface CustomizerLayout {
  left: "Live Preview (in iPhone frame)",
  right: "Control Panel",
  bottom: "Save/Publish Bar"
}

// Every change = instant preview
// No "apply" button needed
// Auto-save every 5 seconds
```

### CSS INJECTION SYSTEM
```css
/* User's custom CSS container */
.campaign-container {
  /* Base styles */
}

/* Injected user styles */
:root {
  --user-primary: #ff006e;
  --user-secondary: #8338ec;
  --user-background: url('...');
  --user-font-main: 'Comic Sans MS';
  --user-glow: 0 0 20px rgba(255,0,110,0.5);
}

/* Safe injection zones */
.user-css-zone {
  /* Sandboxed for custom CSS */
  contain: layout style paint;
}
```

### CUSTOMIZATION DATA MODEL
```javascript
interface ThemeConfig {
  id: string;
  version: number;
  
  // Visual
  colors: ColorScheme;
  fonts: FontConfig;
  background: BackgroundConfig;
  layout: 'poster1' | 'poster2' | etc;
  
  // Interactive
  cursor: CursorEffect;
  music: AudioConfig;
  animations: AnimationSet;
  
  // Widgets
  stickers: StickerPlacement[];
  widgets: WidgetConfig[];
  
  // Advanced
  customCSS?: string; // Post-MVP
  customHTML?: string; // Post-MVP
}
```

### PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS
```javascript
const LIMITS = {
  maxStickers: 20,
  maxFileSize: '5MB',
  maxCustomCSS: '10KB',
  maxAnimations: 5,
  videoMaxLength: '15s',
  audioMaxLength: '30s'
};

// Lazy load non-critical
// CDN all media assets
// CSS animation > JS animation
// RequestAnimationFrame for effects
```

## 🎮 THE CUSTOMIZER UX

### ONBOARDING FLOW
```
First time opens customizer:

"Welcome to Your Design Studio! 🎨"
↓
"Pick a vibe to start" (shows 6 templates)
↓
They pick one
↓
"Now make it yours!" (highlights key tools)
↓
Guided tour of top 3 features
↓
"Go wild!"
```

### QUICK ACTIONS
```javascript
"Randomize Everything" button (chaos mode)
"Copy from URL" (paste another campaign)
"Start from template" (6 options)
"Reset to default"
"Preview on phone"
"Preview on desktop"
```

### PRESET TEMPLATES (Starting Points)
```
1. "Y2K Maximalist" - Glitter, marquee, low-res images
2. "Vaporwave Dream" - Purple/pink gradient, glitch text
3. "Minimalist Drop" - Clean, lots of white, one font
4. "Chaos Mode" - Random everything, cursors go wild
5. "Dark Mode Elegant" - Black, gold accents, sophisticated
6. "Retro Gaming" - Pixel fonts, 8-bit music, coin sounds
```

## 💡 THE SECRET SAUCE

### "Controlled Chaos" Principles:

1. **No Two Pages Look Same**
   - Even with same template, randomize small details
   - Slight rotation variations (±2 degrees)
   - Micro-animations with random delays

2. **Embrace the Jank**
   - Not everything needs to align perfectly
   - Some overflow is okay
   - Loading states can be fun

3. **Discovery Moments**
   ```javascript
   // Hidden features that delight:
   - Konami code unlocks secret themes
   - Click logo 5 times = disco mode
   - Shake phone = randomize colors
   - Type "chaos" = everything goes wild
   ```

4. **Share the Weird**
   - "Most chaotic design" leaderboard
   - "Template of the week" featuring
   - Auto-screenshot best customizations

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Style Injection (Day 1-3)
```javascript
// Simple CSS variable system
const applyTheme = (config) => {
  const root = document.documentElement;
  root.style.setProperty('--primary', config.colors.primary);
  root.style.setProperty('--bg-image', `url(${config.background})`);
  // ... etc
};
```

### Phase 2: Component Library (Day 4-5)
```javascript
// Swappable layout components
<LayoutTemplate type={config.layout}>
  <ProductSection style={config.productStyle} />
  <CounterSection style={config.counterStyle} />
  <SocialProof style={config.socialStyle} />
</LayoutTemplate>
```

### Phase 3: Interactive Elements (Day 6-7)
```javascript
// Cursor, music, animations
useEffect(() => {
  if (config.cursor === 'sparkle') {
    loadSparkleLibrary();
  }
  if (config.music) {
    initAudioPlayer(config.music);
  }
}, [config]);
```

## ✅ CUSTOMIZATION CHECKLIST

**The Vibe Test:**
- [ ] Can you make it look "trashy" on purpose?
- [ ] Can you make it elegant?
- [ ] Can you make it unreadable (and want to)?
- [ ] Does it feel like YOUR space?
- [ ] Would you screenshot it?

**The Technical Test:**
- [ ] Loads in <2 seconds with all customization?
- [ ] Works on 5-year-old phones?
- [ ] Doesn't break checkout flow?
- [ ] Saves automatically?
- [ ] Can copy someone else's style?

---

**The North Star:** If a creator spends more time customizing than they did making their last TikTok, we've won. If buyers ask "how did you make this?" instead of just buying, we've created culture.

**MVP Mantra:** *"Ship the chaos. Polish can wait."*

Ready to build this? Should we dive into the technical architecture or want to explore any specific customization feature deeper?
