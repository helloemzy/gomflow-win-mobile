## üéØ Executive Summary

### Product Vision
GOMFLOW is a viral group-buying platform designed specifically for Indonesian coffee influencers to monetize their audience through coordinated purchasing campaigns. Influencers create time-limited coffee campaigns, followers unlock discounts through social sharing, and everyone wins through bulk purchasing power.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Influencers**: Monetize audience without inventory risk, earn 15-20% commission on sales
- **For Followers**: Access exclusive coffee at group discounts (10-30% off retail)
- **For Coffee Suppliers**: Bulk order validation, guaranteed sales, community marketing

### Target Market
**Primary**: Indonesian micro-influencers (1K-10K followers) focused on coffee, lifestyle, or food content
**Geographic Focus**: Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya (3 major urban centers)
**Market Size**: ~500 coffee influencers, ~2M potential customers

## üöÄ MVP Strategy

### What We're Validating
1. **Demand**: Will Indonesian coffee influencers create group buying campaigns?
2. **Engagement**: Will followers participate and share to unlock discounts?
3. **Virality**: Does the share-to-unlock mechanism drive organic growth?
4. **Economics**: Can we achieve 15-20% commission margins sustainably?

### Success Criteria (4-Week Validation)
- **üéØ Primary**: $5,000 total GMV processed
- **üìà Secondary**: 30% of participants share campaigns  
- **üë• Adoption**: 5 successful campaigns completed
- **üîÑ Retention**: 1 influencer runs second campaign

### Why This Approach
**Ultra-lean validation** over perfect platform. We're testing human behavior and market demand, not building scalable technology. Every feature deferred until we prove people want this.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Stack (Intentionally Simple)
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
Payments: Stripe Checkout (redirect flow, no custom integration)
Hosting: Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub)
Communication: WhatsApp Business API for shares
```

### Database Schema (3 tables only)
```sql
influencers: id, email, tiktok_handle, commission_rate, status
campaigns: id, influencer_id, coffee_product, target_quantity, deadline, status
orders: id, campaign_id, customer_email, quantity, amount, shared_status
```

### No Overengineering Principles
- ‚ùå No microservices, containers, or Kubernetes
- ‚ùå No real-time WebSockets or complex state management  
- ‚ùå No mobile apps (PWA sufficient for MVP)
- ‚ùå No advanced analytics or A/B testing
- ‚ùå No automated fulfillment (manual processing)
- ‚ùå No multi-language support (Indonesian only)

**Supplier Flow (Manual MVP)**:
