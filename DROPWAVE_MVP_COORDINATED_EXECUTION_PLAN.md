## âœ… Final Specialist Alignment

### Coordination Protocol
```yaml
communication:
  daily: "15-min standup at 9 AM SGT"
  weekly: "1-hour sync on Fridays"
  emergency: "WhatsApp group for blockers"
  documentation: "Single shared Notion"

handoffs:
  designer_to_dev: "Figma links by Week 1 end"
  backend_to_frontend: "API docs in Swagger"
  dev_to_founder: "Staging URL for testing"

  - Daily progress visible to all
  - Blockers raised within 2 hours
  - Quality bar: "Works on Indonesian phones"
  - Launch date: Non-negotiable

individual_commitments:
  full_stack_dev: "I will ship working code daily"
  ui_designer: "I will deliver all designs by Week 1"
  founder: "I will have 5 creators ready by Week 3"
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The Bottom Line

**We are building a $45,000 experiment, not a $620,000 platform.**

Every task, every hour, every dollar must directly contribute to answering one question:
**"Will Indonesian creators use group buying to sell?"**

If the answer is yes, we'll have 6 months of runway to build the platform properly.
If the answer is no, we'll have saved $575,000 and 12 weeks.

**Ship ugly. Learn fast. Iterate faster.**
